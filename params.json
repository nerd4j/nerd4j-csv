Mapping is done!  \r\n__@CSVReader__ and __@CSVWriter__ tell the framework that the configuration for a __CSVReader__ and a __CSVWriter__ should be prepared inferring the mapping information from the fields annotated with __@Column__.\r\n\r\nNow you can produce _CsvReader_ and _CSVWriter_ factories using this lines of code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  // This factory is able to pase annotations and XML files and produce a CSVConfiguration.\r\n  final CSVConfigurationFactory configurationFactory = new CSVConfigurationFactory();\r\n\r\n  // The factory reads the annotations in the given class and creates the related CSVConfiguration.\r\n  final CSVConfiguration configuration = configurationFactory.getCSVConfiguration( Model.class );\r\n\t\r\n  // This factory reads the given CSVConfiguration and produces all the objects we need.\r\n\tfinal CSVFactory factory = new CSVFactory( configuration );\r\n\r\n  // This factory produces CSVReaders properly configured to populate our model.\r\n  final CSVReaderFactory readerFactory = factory.getCSVReaderFactory( Model.class.getCanonicalName() );\r\n\r\n  // This factory produces CSVWriters properly configured to write our model into a CSV record.\r\n  final CSVWriterFactory writerFactory = factory.getCSVWriterFactory( Model.class.getCanonicalName() );\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou are almost done, all you have to do now is read and write your CSV files.  \r\nThe _CSVReaderFactory_ produces a _CSVReader_ for a given file, working with factories is not much work for a single file and becomes very convenient when you need to read a lot of files with the same model.\r\n\r\nNow let's do the job:\r\n```java\r\n  try( \r\n    final CSVReader<Model> reader = readerFactory.getCSVReader( new File(\"source.csv\") );\r\n    final CSVWriter<Model> writer = writerFactory.getCSVWriter( new File(\"target.csv\") );\r\n  )\r\n  {\r\n    Model model = null;\r\n    while( ! reader.isEndOfData() )\r\n    {\r\n      model = reader.readModel();\r\n      // Do something....\r\n      writer.writeModel( model );\r\n    }\r\n  }catch( IOException ex )\r\n  {\r\n    // Handle IO Exception\r\n  }catch(CSVToModelBindingException | ModelToCSVBindingException ex )\r\n  {\r\n    // Handle Model Binding Exception\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it!!  \r\nWith a few lines of code you are able to read and write CSV files using your own data model.\r\nBut the framework is highly configurable and can cover almost all the needs that a developer can face working on CSV files.\r\n\r\nFor more details about the features of the nerd4j-csv framework see our [wiki](https://github.com/nerd4j/nerd4j-csv/wiki).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
